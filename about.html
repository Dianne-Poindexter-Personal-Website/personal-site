<h1> Bio </h1>
<p1>As an only child my imagination has always run wild, and well into my adult years, I still dream with vigor an optimism. Throughout my middle school and college years I studied architectural drafting and interior design. My current passions are in the realm of behavioral analytics and astrology. As I continue to build my wealth and professional network, to further the development of this projects, I still dream to work for CoStar mobile application or partner with them. My last name is Poindexter and I want my legacy to be a cliche as it sounds, mark me in the books as a #bigDataEvolutionist!</p1>
